-<P>For the client, a DSL, cable modem or faster connection yields the best \

-a large PowerPoint presentation over a dial-up connection can be slow, \
-taking about 3 to 5 minutes per megabyte. Unlike some other \

+<P><B>How secure is WebHuddle?</B></P> \
+<P>WebHuddle is \
+highly secure. All network communication travels via the standard \
+encrypted browser protocol known as HTTPS.  This is the same protocol that is \
 used the world over for applications that demand absolute security, \
-such as online banking. Instead of using an untested, home-grown \
-protocol, {8} relies on the industry standard that has proven \
-itself in hundreds of millions of transactions.  Technically \
-speaking, HTTPS is HTTP on top of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).  HTTPS \
-virtually guarantees the identity of the server, and the privacy and integrity \
-of data sent over the network.  {8} sends all data -- including \
-voice -- through secure sockets, not just chat or some subset of the \
-content types.  With {8}, security is complete and built-in, \

 <P><B>What type of content may I upload for my meeting?</B></P> \
 <P>You may upload any combination of Microsoft Powerpoint files, \
 Open Office Impress files, \
 individual GIF or JPEG images, and ZIP files containing GIF or JPEG \

-displayed in {8}.</P> \
-<P><B>Why are Powerpoint animations not displayed?</B></P> \
-<P>{8} strives to be simple, small, and efficient on multiple \
-platforms, including Linux, Windows, Solaris and Mac.  Preserving \
-Powerpoint animations would require the installation of the Powerpoint \
-viewer on each client or the creation of such a viewer on platforms \

-<P><B>How does voice-over-IP work?</B></P> \
-<P>Voice-over-IP is an optional feature especially suited to larger meetings and \
-meetings you wish to record.  One person may speak at a time and the \
-moderator controls the virtual microphone.  The speaking person must have \
-a working microphone installed on their computer.  Participants need a \
-working headset or loudspeakers to hear voice-over-IP.  To use VOIP, \
-the host enables the option when starting the meeting.  Once in \
-the meeting, the moderator selects a user from the roster and presses the microphone \
-button.  That user is now "on air" and others will hear them speak if \
-their microphone is set up properly.</P> \
+<P><B>How is voice handled?</B></P> \
+<P>Voice-over-IP capability is largely integrated with WebHuddle, \
+and will be added to your application at a future time. For now, \
+you need to use a third-party voice conference solution, \
