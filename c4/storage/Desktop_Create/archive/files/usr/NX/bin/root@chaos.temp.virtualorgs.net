# When printer is connected for the first time and BLOCK_PRINT_DIALOG is set to 1
# nxclient starts the dialog to choose the printer driver driver.  
# The nxclient will also display the "successful" attachment
# dialog the first time, through the use of the PRINTER_DRIVER_SELECTED file in
# the user's home/.nx/config directory.
# The next time the driver is selected without displaying the
# confirmation dialog, or the successful attachment dialog.
#
# When BLOCK_FILE_DIALOG is set to 1, all SMB mounting messages
# will be suppressed
#
# All other dialogs are not filtered.
